# csv-combiner
Combine all CSV files in a folder into one file
 
 Select the folder whose contents you want to combine on line 4.
 On line 7 select a search term to use, e.g., you want to combine all .csv that start with "file", you would enter file in the quotes.
 line 8 selects which columns you want to pull.
 Finally on line 11 you can select where to store the combined file and what name to use. Need pandas installed to work correctly.
